# Base16 Pinkie Pie Theme

This the Atom version of my Pinkie Pie inspired [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder) theme. The YAML definition
can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/railsbros-dirk/6901884).

The theme was created with the [TextMate bundle converter](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-theme).
